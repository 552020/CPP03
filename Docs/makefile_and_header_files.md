Certainly! The `DEPFLAGS` variable in the Makefile is used to pass additional flags to the compiler for generating dependency files during the compilation of `.cpp` source files into `.o` object files. The flags `-MMD` and `-MP` are specifically related to this dependency generation process. Here's what each flag does:

### `-MMD`

- The `-MMD` flag tells the compiler to generate dependency files (`.d` files) along with the object files (`.o`). These dependency files contain Makefile rules describing the dependencies of each source file on various header files.
- Unlike the `-MD` flag, which includes system headers in the dependency files, `-MMD` excludes system headers from the dependency list, focusing on the user's headers, which are more likely to change and trigger a necessary recompilation.
- Dependency files list all the header files that each source file includes (either directly or indirectly). This allows the Makefile to know which source files need to be recompiled when a header file changes.

### `-MP`

- The `-MP` flag adds a phony target for each dependency other than the main file, preventing make errors if you delete or rename header files.
- Without `-MP`, if a header file listed in a `.d` file is removed from the project, `make` might fail due to missing targets. Adding a phony target for each dependency ensures that `make` won't break even if a header file is removed, as the phony target doesn't correspond to a real file but prevents make errors.

### When Are Header Files Needed?

- **Compilation Phase**: Header files are needed during the compilation phase when the source `.cpp` files are being transformed into object `.o` files. The compiler uses the declarations in header files to ensure that the source code uses correctly defined functions, classes, variables, etc. This phase checks for syntax, type correctness, and other compile-time aspects. The dependency files generated with `-MMD` and `-MP` flags help track which source files need to be recompiled when header files change.
- **Linking Phase**: Header files are not directly used during the linking phase. The linking phase deals with combining object files into the final executable or library, resolving references between object files, such as function calls or global variables used across different source files. By this point, all the necessary information from the header files has already been incorporated into the object files during the compilation phase.

In summary, the `DEPFLAGS` with `-MMD` and `-MP` enhance the Makefile's ability to automatically track and manage dependencies on header files, ensuring that changes to headers lead to the appropriate recompilation of affected source files. This setup significantly simplifies project maintenance and build correctness, especially as projects grow in size and complexity.
